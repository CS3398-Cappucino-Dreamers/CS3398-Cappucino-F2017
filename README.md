Fit or Die offers a new take on fitness apps. Unlike other fitness apps you can't just quit. In Fit or Die, users are given an avatar which corresponds to your activity in the app. As you become more fit, so will your avatar. However, if you stop actively working out, your avatar will die and your account will be locked. We know some people deserve second chances, so to get back into your account users can either complete a difficult fitness challenge or pay a small fee to open it back up.

<b>Application:<b> The Login activity has sliding fragments that display info about the app while the bottom half of the screen allows users to log in. The login fields are not yet connected to a database, nor are the signup fields. The login button will take you to the homepage which has a functioning progress circle on the page. On that page a temporary calendar button is visible to take you to the calendar activity which will be later removed. The sign-up page is linked to the login page and has fields for signing up.

<b>Design:</b> The design basics are mapped out in sketches and not yet implemented into the app. The artifacts that have been completed so far are visible in the comments under the issue that they apply to. 
  
  
<b>Database:</b> The database (MySQL) is set up and running. The next steps will be setting up the API server between our app and the database. Also setting up remote desktop so others can work on it or use it for testing if needed.
  
  
<b>Miscellaneous:</b>
